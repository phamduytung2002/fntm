Some needs:
- group config for topics
- Word/topic embeding visualization, with group
- group regularization
- preprocess bert embedding
- batching
- MMI loss
- BPEMB

Note for folder Data:
- the data is preprocessed
- only 20NG in datasets folder is not preprocessed
    bert embedding should taken from here

Every basic model contains:
- __init__
- reparameterize
- encode
- get_theta
- get_beta
- forward
    return dict: {'loss': xyz}
- loss_function
- (decode)
